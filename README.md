# Matreex
Matreex is a new dynamic tool to scale-up the visualisation of gene families. Matreex’s key idea is to use “phylogenetic” profiles to minimise the information loss when collapsing subtrees. These profiles are dense representations of gene repertoires but in themselves lack evolutionary relations. Thus combining the two approaches of subtree collapse and profiles provides both phylogenetic context and compact information. Furthermore, by building on the [phylo.IO viewer](https://beta.phylo.io/viewer/) framework, Matreex provides a very responsive user interface.
